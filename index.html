                <p>C. Subramaniyan  was born in a <i>Brahmin family</i> on 11 December 1882 in the village of <b>Ettayapuram, Tamil Nadu</b> to Chinnaswami Subramania Iyer and Lakshmi Amma.

                 <p>During his stay in<b> Varanasi</b>, Bharathi was exposed to <b>Hindu spirituality</b> and nationalism. This broadened his outlook and he learned Sanskrit, Hindi and English. In addition, he changed his outward appearance. He also grew a beard and wore a turban due to his admiration of Sikhs, influenced by his Sikh friend. Though he passed an entrance exam for a job, he returned to Ettayapuram during 1901 and started as the court poet of Raja of Ettayapuram for a couple of years. He was a Tamil teacher from August to November 1904 in Sethupathy High School in Madurai. During this period, Bharathi understood the need to be well-informed of the world outside and took interest in the world of journalism and the print media of the West. Bharathi joined as Assistant Editor of the<b> Swadesamitran,</b> a Tamil daily in 1904. In December 1905, he attended the All India Congress session held in Benaras. On his journey back home, he met<b> Sister Nivedita, Swami Vivekananda's</b> spiritual heir. She inspire Bharathi to recognise the privileges of women and the emancipation of women exercised Bharathi's mind. He visualised the new woman as an emanation of Shakti, a willing helpmate of man to build a new earth through co-operative endeavour. Among other greats such as Bal Gangadhar Tilak, he considered Nivedita his Guru, and penned verses in her praise. He attended the Indian National Congress session in Calcutta under Dadabhai Naoiroji, which demanded Swaraj and boycott of British goods.</p>

                    <p>By April 1907, he started editing the Tamil weekly <i>India</i> and the English newspaper <i>Bala Bharatham</i> with <b>M.P.T. Acharya.</b> These newspapers were also a means of expressing Bharathi's creativity, which began to peak during this period. Bharathi started to publish his poems regularly in these editions. From hymns to nationalistic writings, from contemplations on the relationship between God and Man to songs on the <b>Russian</b> and<b> French</b> revolutions, Bharathi's subjects were diverse.</p>
                    
                  <p>  Bharathi participated in the historic Surat Congress in 1907 along with<b> V.O. Chidambaram</b> Pillai and Mandayam Srinivachariar, which deepened the divisions within the <b>Indian National Congress</b> with a section preferring armed resistance, primarily led by<i> Tilak</i> over moderate approach preferred by certain other sections. Bharathi supported Tilak with <b>V. O. Chidambaram Pillai </b>and Kanchi Varathachariyar. Tilak openly supported armed resistance against the British.</p>
                                     
                  <p>  In 1908, the British instituted a case against V.O. Chidambaram Pillai. In the same year, the proprietor of the journal India was arrested in<i> Madras.</i> Faced with the prospect of arrest, Bharathi escaped to<b> Pondicherry,</b> which was under French rule. From there he edited and published the weekly journal<i> India, Vijaya, a Tamil daily, Bala Bharatham,</i> an English monthly, and<i> Suryodayam,</i> a local weekly in Pondicherry. The British tried to suppress Bharathi's output by stopping remittances and letters to the papers. Both<i> India</i> and<i> Vijaya</i> were banned in India in 1909.</p>

                   <p> During his exile, Bharathi had the opportunity to meet many other leaders of the revolutionary wing of the Independence movement like <b>Aurobindo, Lajpat Rai</b> and V.V.S. Aiyar, who had also sought asylum under the French. Bharathi assisted Aurobindo in the <b>Arya</b> journal and later Karma Yogi in Pondicherry. This was also the period when he started learning Vedic literature. Three of his greatest works namely,<i> Kuyil Pattu, Panchali Sapatham</i> and<i> Kannan Pattu</i> were composed during 1912. He also translated Vedic hymns, Patanjali's<i> Yoga Sutra</i> and<i> Bhagavat Gita</i> to Tamil.Bharathi entered India near <b>Cuddalore</b> in November 1918 and was promptly arrested. He was imprisoned in the Central prison in Cuddalore in custody for three weeks from 20 November to 14 December and was released after the intervention of<b> Annie Besant</b> and<b> C.P. Ramaswamy Aiyar.</b> He was stricken by poverty during this period, resulting in his ill health. The following year, 1919, Bharathi met<b> Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.</b> He resumed editing <b>Swadesimeitran</b> from 1920 in <b>Madras</b> (modern-day Chennai).</p>

           <p> He was badly affected by the imprisonments and by 1920 when a General Amnesty Order finally removed restrictions on his movements, Bharathi was already struggling. He was struck by an elephant named Lavanya at <b>Parthasarathy temple, Triplicane, Chennai,</b> whom he used to feed every day. When he fed a coconut to Lavanya (the elephant), the elephant attacked Bharathi. Although he survived the incident, his health deteriorated a few months later and he died early morning on 11 September 1921 at around 1 am. Though Bharathi was considered a people's poet, a great nationalist, outstanding freedom fighter and social visionary, it was recorded that there were only 14 people to attend his funeral. He delivered his last speech at Karungalpalayam Library in <b>Erode,</b> which was about the topic Man is <i>Immortal.</i> The last years of his life were spent in a house in <b>Triplicane, Chennai.</b> The house was bought and renovated by the <b>Government of Tamil Nadu</b> in 1993 and named Bharathi Illam (Home of Bharathi).
